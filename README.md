# aave_panic_bot
A Telegram Bot that tells you if you should panic based on AAVE rates

# What it does

This bot delivers loan warnings based on the AAVE-Polygon WMATIC rates:

1. A loan makes money by itself, the incentive reward is higher than the borrowing rate
2. The borrowing rate is higher than the borrowing rate, but lending the amount borrowed still makes the borrowing + lending profitable
3. The borrowing rate is so high that even lending the borrowed amount is not profitable

This is only for MATIC.
